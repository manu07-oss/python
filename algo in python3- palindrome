Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1



answer
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        # Check if x is negative or ends with 0 (excluding 0 itself)
        if x < 0 or (x % 10 == 0 and x != 0):
            return False

        half = 0
        while x > half:
            half = (half * 10) + (x % 10)
            x = x // 10
        return x == half or x == half // 10

# Test cases
sol = Solution()
print(sol.isPalindrome(121))  # Output: True
print(sol.isPalindrome(-121)) # Output: False
print(sol.isPalindrome(10))   # Output: False
